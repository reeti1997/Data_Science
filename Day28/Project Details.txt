The details of the live project are as follows: 

We will work on analyzing the weather in New Delhi. For that, first of all, you need to crawl the data. 

Write a script that crawls all the weather related parameters (hourly). 

After that, generate some insights from it via data visualizations. 

Also crawl weather parameters from cities around Delhi to see if they have any correlation with Delhi's weather 

Make sure that you get as much data as possible so that we can get accurate results. 

Next step will be to make a predictive model which predicts the weather every three hours. The results of the model should be optimized using root mean squared error and proper validation techniques. 

This project should give you a feel of the entire data science pipeline. that is: 

1) Data Fetching 

2) Data Analysis 

3) Data Visualization 

4) Feature Engineering 

5) Data Modelling 

6) Metric Optimization 

7) Cross Validation
